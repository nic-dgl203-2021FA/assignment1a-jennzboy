            <h3>Social Good Poster</h3>
            <p>I created this poster for an assignment in my DGL 102 class, Graphic Design Foundations. The purpose of this assignment was to create a poster inspired by a designer of your choice, about a social cause to inspire action.</p>
            <p>This poster was inspired by the work of Kel Lauren, and I chose the social cause defund the police, because of the problem of police brutality throughout the world.</p>

            <img src="images/Advert.jpg" alt="Distillery Advert">
            <h3>Distillery Advert</h3>
            <p>I created this advert for an assignment in my DGL 112 Typography class. The purpose of this assignment was to create a wordmark for a distillery brand using negative space, and an advert with a persuasive message about the brands unique selling points.</p>
            <p>For this assignment, I created the brand Crescent Moon Distillery, and used crescent moons in place of the o's in 'moon' to show use of negative space. The goal of the advert was to show that the distillery used locally sourced, organic ingredients in their liquor, and to showcase that with a refreshing cocktail illustration.</p>

          <section class="project-item">
            <img src="images/MagazineCover.jpg" alt="Too Good Magazine">
            <h3>Magazine Cover</h3>
            <p>I created this magazine cover for an assignment in my DGL 112 Typography class. The purpose of this assignment was to create a magazine cover for a fictional magazine, with a focus on text, typography and composition. </p>
            <p>For this assignment, I created the arts and culture magazine Too Good. The cover image is from Unsplash and was taken by Jon Tyson. I wanted Too Good magazine to feel very fun and vibrant, and I experimented with a bold and decorative font for the nameplate. The headlines feature articles about some of my favourite artists and musicians. </p>

            <img src="images/MagazineImpressum.png" alt="Too Good Impressum">
            <h3>Magazine Impressum and Letter from the Editor</h3>
            <p>I created this magazine page for an assignment in my DGL 112 Typography class. The purpose of this assignment was to create an impressum (a list of all those who worked on the magazine) and letter from the editor as a continuation of the magazine cover assignment. This magazine page needed to have a strong coherent visual character that was consistent with the magazine cover. </p>
            <p>For this assignment, I created the magazine page to have the same fun and vibrant aesthetic as the cover page, while also being functional. The letter from the editor briefly outlines what each of the articles on the cover are about.</p>
